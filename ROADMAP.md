# Roadmap

Feature todo list in order:

- dont allow class_pa of strict type values, swap token
- __leave_scope
- __before_free
- Type check internal functions ownership of all arguments
- Calling functions using named arguments
- Package manager
- Testing features
- Declare functions for classes/structs from other libraries
- vscode extension
- Async library
- Cross compiling
- Anonymous functions

## Maybe

- Interfaces | they are kind of pointless because we dont use virtual functions and therefore cant use them as types

## Done

- Strict ownership types
- Shared ownership types
- Threading
- Check class property access types (public,private,readonly)
- Custom iterators
- Define which arguments need to take ownership
- Error handling
- Ownership algorithm
- Generics
- Traits
- ?? | ?!
