# Roadmap

Feature todo list in order:

- Custom iterators
- %keep tags in function arguments, to keep ownership and not share it
- Check class property access types (public,private,readonly)
- Calling functions using named arguments
- Package manager
- Testing features
- Declare functions for classes/structs from other libraries
- vscode extension
- Strict ownership types
- Shared ownership types
- Async library
- Cross compiling
- Anonymous functions

## Maybe

- Interfaces | they are kind of pointless because we dont use virtual functions and therefore cant use them as types
