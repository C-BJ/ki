# Roadmap

Feature todo list in order:

- Error handling
- Calling functions with named arguments
- Package manager
- Testing features
- Declare functions for classes/structs from other libraries
- Strict ownership types
- Shared ownership types
- Async library
- Cross compiling
- Anonymous functions

## Maybe

- Interfaces | they are kind of pointless because we dont use virtual functions and therefore cant use them as types
